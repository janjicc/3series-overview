        <h2> The History Of The BMW 3 Series </h2>
        <h3> The most popular BMW series</h3>

        <img src="images/background1.jpg" class="test-feature1">

        <p> The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW">BMW</a> 3 Series 
            is a compact executive car manufactured
            by the German automaker BMW since May 1975. It is the
            successor to the 02 Series and has been produced in
            seven different generations.</p>
        <p> The first generation of the 3 Series was only available 
            as a 2-door coupé; however, the model range has since 
            expanded to include a 4-door saloon, 2-door convertible, 
            2-door coupé, 5-door estate, 5-door liftback ("Gran Turismo") 
            and 3-door hatchback body styles. Since 2013, the coupé 
            and convertible models have been marketed as the 4 Series; 
            therefore, the 3 Series range no longer includes these 
            body styles. </p>
